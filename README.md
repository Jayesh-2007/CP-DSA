## 🧠 Example Content

In the `Stack` folder:
- `directory_namecpp`: Implements stack using arrays and linked lists
- `stack_questions.md`: Interview-style questions based on stacks
- `stack_answers.md`: Detailed solutions with C++ code

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: **C++ (C++11 and above)**  
- Tools: g++, VS Code, Git
 Note: 
- If you're a macOS user, you likely already have `clang++` installed via Xcode Command Line Tools.
- If you're a Windows user, you need to install MinGW to use the `g++` compiler.
